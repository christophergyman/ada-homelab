# 🏠 My Homelab

Welcome to my homelab showcase! This repository is less about code and more about the systems and tools I've set up to manage my personal tech infrastructure. It's a space where I experiment, optimise, and learn — all while making my digital life more private, efficient, and enjoyable.

## ✨ Highlights

Here’s a breakdown of what I’ve built and manage within my homelab:

### 🧠 System Monitoring
- Multi-container monitoring using **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **cAdvisor**
- Real-time metrics across all services
- Custom dashboards for CPU, memory, disk, and container health

### 📱 Device Management
- Centralised management for all personal tech devices (laptops, phones, Raspberry Pis, etc.)
- Automated patching, backups, and configuration sync

### 🌐 DNS & Networking
- Custom DNS dashboard with per-device routing
- Self-hosted **Pi-hole** or **AdGuard Home** for ad/tracker blocking
- Internal domain names for all local services
- DNS-based VPN routing and filtering

### 📤 Local File Sharing (AirDrop Clone)
- Peer-to-peer file transfer across devices
- Cross-platform support (iOS/Android/macOS/Linux)
- Web-based interface for ease of use

### 🌍 Web Hosting
- Hosting my [personal website](https://example.com) from within the lab
- HTTPS via internal reverse proxy (Caddy / Nginx)
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions for updates

## 🧪 Why I Built This

- To learn infrastructure tools hands-on
- To reduce reliance on cloud services
- To create a self-hosted, privacy-respecting digital environment
- To manage and automate everything from a central point

---

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Add HA (High Availability) with failover
- Set up Kubernetes (or k3s) for container orchestration
- Create automated backups to cold storage
- Integrate smart home devices

---

## 🗂️ Repo Structure

This repo mainly contains:
- 📸 Screenshots
- 📝 Config snippets
- 📚 Documentation on each component (coming soon)
